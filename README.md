# EDM-subgenre-classifier
This repository contains the code for "[Deep Learning Based EDM Subgenre Classification using Mel-Spectrogram and Tempogram Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08862)" arXiv:2110.08862, 2021. Wei-Han Hsu, Bo-Yu Chen, Yi-Hsuan Yang

## Prerequisites

* Python  == 3.6.13
* librosa == 0.8.1
* torch   == 1.3.0
* numpy   == 1.16.0
* pandas  == 1.1.2

## Running the application

You could run
  <pre><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
to make the part of installing dependencies.

Then run
  <pre><code>python3 main.py [music files name] [pre-trained model]</code></pre>
could predict the song's genre directly.
For example:
* "music file name" --> abcd.mp3. You will need to create "audio" folder under the data manually and put your music file under it. (./data/audio/abcd.mp3)
* "pre-trained-model" just have only one pkl file --> joint-model-all-2500.pkl

Here are the steps to run the code:
* Step 1 : Preparing the audio (mp3, wav) and put it under "./data/audio/"
* Step 2 : Extracting the feature, and the feature will under the ./data/{feature_folder}" (feature_folder : mel-spectrogram, fourier-tempogram and auto-tempogram)
* Step 3 : Classifying the audio by feature
* Step 4 : The result will be in the "./result.csv"
* All the "step" could complete by main.py

We only put the "late-fusion model" in this repo.
